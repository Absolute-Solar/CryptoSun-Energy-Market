## Overview

CryptoSun is a revolutionary blockchain-based marketplace for renewable energy trading, focusing on solar energy production and consumption. The platform leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized energy ecosystem that:

- Enables direct peer-to-peer energy trading
- Tokenizes solar energy production through Solar Energy Tokens (SETs)
- Provides transparent pricing and real-time energy market access
- Creates economic incentives for renewable energy adoption

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Energy Trading**: Direct P2P energy exchange between producers and consumers
- **Tokenized Solar Assets**: Solar Energy Tokens (SETs) backed by actual energy production
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Automated trading, settlement, and dividend distribution
- **Dynamic Pricing Algorithm**: Real-time price discovery based on supply and demand
- **Energy Traceability**: Transparent tracking of energy origin and consumption
- **Support for Energy Storage**: Integration with battery storage systems
- **Microgrids Support**: Enable community-based energy sharing networks

## Technical Architecture

CryptoSun is built on a multi-layered architecture:

1. **Blockchain Layer**: Core smart contracts for token management and market operations
2. **Market Layer**: Order book, price discovery mechanism, and matching algorithms
3. **Integration Layer**: APIs and interfaces for hardware integration and external services
4. **Application Layer**: User interfaces for different stakeholders

## Smart Contracts

The repository includes the following core contracts:

- `SolarEnergyToken.sol`: ERC-20 compatible token representing energy production
- `EnergyMarket.sol`: P2P marketplace for energy trading
- `SolarAssetRegistry.sol`: Registry of solar installations and their production capacity
- `EnergySettlement.sol`: Handles financial settlements between participants
- `EnergyStorage.sol`: Integration with battery storage systems
- `MicrogridController.sol`: Manages local energy community operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+
- Hardhat
- Solidity v0.8.x
- MetaMask or other Web3 wallet

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Absolute-Solar/cryptosun-energy-market.git
cd cryptosun-energy-market

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to local network
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
```

## Market Mechanism

CryptoSun implements a unique market mechanism where:

1. Solar energy producers mint SETs based on verified production
2. Energy consumers can buy SETs directly from producers or on the marketplace
3. Smart contracts automatically execute trades when conditions are met
4. Settlement occurs in real-time with transparent pricing
5. Energy distribution is coordinated with grid operators through oracles

## Security

CryptoSun implements several security measures:

- Smart contract audits by independent security firms
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Rate limiting for token minting based on verified production
- Oracle data verification and cross-checking

## Use Cases

- **Residential Solar Producers**: Monetize excess energy production
- **Energy Consumers**: Purchase renewable energy directly from producers
- **Grid Operators**: Better manage fluctuations in renewable energy production
- **Investors**: Participate in renewable energy markets through tokenized assets
- **Community Microgrids**: Enable local energy trading and resilience

## Future Roadmap

1. **Q3 2025**: Launch of initial marketplace with basic P2P trading
2. **Q4 2025**: Integration with major solar panel manufacturers for automated SET minting
3. **Q1 2026**: Energy storage integration for time-shifted energy usage
4. **Q2 2026**: Microgrid support for community-based energy trading
5. **Q3 2026**: Cross-chain interoperability for larger market reach
